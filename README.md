## User Needs and Personal Research Conduction
While I bought the Arduino Uno Kit, I didn’t really know how to use many of the components the kit had to offer. But in my research about the functionalities of the components, I realized I can make a simplified version of Solar Panel Pathway Lights to put outside of your house.
## Functionality
What these lights do is charge up during the day with the sun’s ultraviolet radiation hitting the solar panels. Then at night, the photoresistor detects that there is an absence of light, so it will signal the small pathway lights to turn on. 
## identify Needs
Users of this pathway lights system would be for people arriving home late from work as it helps them reach their door safely. People with gardens can use these lights to look at their garden at night. Also, in the real world, there are road lights on many roads and neighborhoods to help people see better when driving or walking in the dark. In general, these lights are useful to guide people around at night.
## Designing idea and Research 
This design is developed with the use of a photoresistor. “A photoresistor is a sensor that changes its resistance when light shines on it. The resistance generated varies depending on the light striking at his surface” (sciencedirect). When I was reading on these pathway lights on https://home.howstuffworks.com/solar-light.htm , I understood how the lights were turning on at night and thought I should give this a try. <br>
**The main take away here is:** The photoresistor is the part of a solar light that tells it when to turn on and off. During the day, the photocell is exposed to daylight, and this prevents electricity from flowing through it to the LED light. 
In the article they talked about how, “at night, the solar cells stop producing power. The photoresistor turns on the LED” (howstuffworks). So, I used this as inspiration and incorporated this simple idea into my Arduino Uno build. The photoresistor is the first part included in the project, and I did not get the chance to incorporate a solar panel system due to not having any. I also learned more about resistors and how they, “regulates the flow of electrical current in an electronic circuit” (techtarget).
